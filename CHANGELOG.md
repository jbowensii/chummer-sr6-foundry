# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- First release: imports Chummer SR6 export v1 files (Chummer's Shadowrun 6 side) into shadowrun6-eden 4.x on Foundry 13 and 14 (tested with shadowrun6-eden 4.0.9; a newer version warns, another system is refused).
- A file is checked before anything in the world changes; a Chummer Anarchy 2.0 file, a newer format version or a damaged file is refused with the reason.
- Runners become Player actors in the Actors folder "Chummer SR6": attribute bases, skill points and specializations, magic or resonance type, Edge, and their items (weapons, armor, augmentations with their bonuses as item effects, electronics, gear, vehicles and drones, spells, rituals, adept powers, complex forms, metamagics, echoes, qualities, contacts, lifestyles, SINs, knowledge and language skills). shadowrun6-eden derives pools, monitors, initiative and essence.
- NPCs, critters, spirits and sprites become NPC, Critter, Spirit and sprite actors in "Chummer SR6 NPCs", with the GM-only facts in their notes and hostile, unlinked tokens.
- Replace, Add as new version and Skip for actors already in the world; Replace keeps play state, ownership, your own items and art you picked.
- Book data and GM compendiums become world compendiums per book and topic in "Chummer SR6" and "Chummer SR6 compendiums" (House); never an empty compendium; re-import replaces by id and keeps your own entries, pages and art.
- Separate portrait and token images; default icons per item category (from the Chummer Anarchy 2.0 Importer's set) and an "Apply icons" settings menu.
- Unit tests (Vitest) and In-Foundry tests (Quench).
